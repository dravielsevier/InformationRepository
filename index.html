<h1>Resupply Knowledgebase</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Resupplies of Items are requested to rectify errors discovered in the publication of Items or when a re-run (resupply of articles so that these are typeset in new typeset model) is required. This document guides Journal Managers through decisions needed to request revisions to Items and Issues, depending on the stage of the Item or Issue in the workflow.<br>
  The below table provides information regarding to which scenario whether a resupply or a corrigendum is needed.
</p>

<h2>Sample Email Template Drafts</h2>

<div class="template">
  <strong>1. Denying author's affiliation change (introducing a totally new affiliation) post S250:</strong><br>
  Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the article [].<br>
  I understand that one of the author's affiliation needs correction.  Kindly note that changing the author affiliation post publication of the article is generally not allowed, as the affiliation listed in a published article which reflects the author's institution at the time the research was conducted and submitted needs to be retained.<br>
  I trust that this is acceptable and I apologize that we are unable to proceed with this correction as requested.<br>
  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
</div>
<div class="template">
  <strong>2. Denying late correction post S250 and suggesting a Corrigendum where required:</strong><br>
  Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the article [].<br>
  I'm sorry to hear that your article needs additional corrections [you can be more specific here by mentioning the correction being requested by the author].  After reviewing the system, I see that based on the corrections submitted during the proofing stage, the article has already been finalized and published in its complete citable form on Science Direct. Unfortunately, this means that no further changes can be made online.<br>
  However, if this is a significant error that requires correction, I would be happy to assist you in publishing an editor-approved Corrigendum linked to your original paper.  Kindly complete and return the attached Elsevier-approved format for the corrigendum so I can submit it to the Editor for approval. Depending on the editor's decision, the corrigendum can be published in the next available issue of the journal.<br>
  Please be aware that the text of the corrigendum will be published exactly as you submit it, so kindly ensure that it reflects the precise amendment you wish to make rather than a request for correction.<br>
  If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me, and I will be glad to help.
</div>
<div class="template">
  <strong>3. Denying author's late corrections request post publication of the article for minor typos:</strong><br>
  Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your published article []. We appreciate your attention to detail and commitment to ensuring the accuracy of your published work.<br>
  As per our publication policy, we typically do not make corrections to articles after they have been published unless the changes involve critical errors that significantly impact the content or interpretation of the research (in which case we publish an Editor approved corrigendum linked to the original article). Minor typos, while important, do not fall under this category, and we must maintain the integrity of the published version.<br>
  We understand that this may be disappointing, but please rest assured that such minor errors do not detract from the overall quality and impact of your article.<br>
  Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to your continued contributions in the future.
</div>
<div class="template">
  <strong>4. Dealing with late corrections to acknowledgements post S250:</strong><br>
  Thank you for contacting us regarding the article [].<br>
  I understand that you would like to make changes to the acknowledgments section of the above referenced article. Kindly note that no modifications to the acknowledgments section after acceptance of the article is allowed.<br>
  However, if this is critical and must be corrected, I can surely assist you in the publication of an editor approved Corrigendum article linked to your original paper. Could you kindly fill and return the attached Elsevier approved format of the corrigendum along with the below information:<br>
  a) The reason for this correction in acknowledgement text being requested at this stage<br>
  b) A formal statement from the listed supporting institutions agreeing for this change<br>
  I can run it with the Editor for approval. Based on the editor's decision, the corrigendum can be published in the next available Issue of the journal.<br>
  Please note that the text of the corrigendum will be published as submitted by you hence could you kindly ensure it is not a requisition for correction but the exact amendment you wish to publish.
</div>
<div class="template">
  <strong>5. Denying author's request for late correction post S250 when they say it was a production error however it was not a production error:</strong><br>
  Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the article [].<br>

After reviewing the system, I see that based on the corrections submitted during the proofing stage (corrections list received during proofing stage is attached for your quick glance), the article has already been finalized and published in its complete citable form on Science Direct after incorporating all the requested corrections. Unfortunately, this means that no further changes can be made online.<br>
  However, if this is a significant error that requires correction, I would be happy to assist you in publishing an editor-approved Corrigendum linked to your original paper. Kindly complete and return the attached Elsevier-approved format for the corrigendum so I can submit it to the Editor for approval. Depending on the editor's decision, the corrigendum can be published in the next available issue of the journal.<br>
  Please be aware that the text of the corrigendum will be published exactly as you submit it, so kindly ensure that it reflects the precise amendment you wish to make rather than a request for correction.<br>
  If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me, and I will be glad to help.

  <strong>6. Denying Revised Proof requested by author:</strong><br>
  Thank you for your recent correspondence regarding the revised proof of your article []. We appreciate your attention to detail and your commitment to ensuring the accuracy of your work.<br>
  However, I must inform you that, as per our publication policy, we are unable to accommodate requests for a revised proof once the initial corrections have been submitted and the proof has been finalized. This procedure helps us maintain our publishing schedule and ensures that we can deliver your work to readers in a timely manner. [Add facts substantiating your denial for revised proof if JM finds it not really needed in this case eg., Also I noticed that the corrections submitted are minimal (only 3 edits)], and I can assure you that these corrections will be incorporated exactly as requested and if there are any challenges we shall get back to you before finalizing the article online.<br>
  We truly value your understanding in this matter and are excited to see your corrected article published. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.<br>
  Thank you for your cooperation.

<div class="template">
  <strong>7. Denying Change in corresponding author request (post acceptance) if author confirms that it is needed for accessing funding for article publishing charges (APCs):</strong><br>
  Thank you for your recent request regarding the change of corresponding author for your article [].<br>
  Kindly note that authors have the freedom to select the corresponding author prior to submission in accordance with any guidance from their funders, institutions, and the journal's requirements, however changes to the corresponding author solely for the purpose of accessing funding for article publishing charges (APCs) cannot be accommodated post acceptance of the article.<br>
  I trust that this is acceptable and I apologize that we are unable to make this change as requested.<br>
  If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.
</div>
<div class="template">
  <strong>8. Denying Multiple Corresponding author request:</strong><br>
  Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the change of corresponding author for your article [].<br>
  I understand that [] should also be tagged as corresponding author alongside your name, kindly note that as per recent updates to the journal's standard policy, we no longer allow multiple corresponding authors due to the fact that in principle, the role of the corresponding author is to liaise with the journal and hence there should be no need for more than one corresponding author unless they are in 2 different fields.<br>
  I trust that this is acceptable and I apologize that we are unable to make this change as requested.<br>
  If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.
</div>
<div class="template">
  <strong>9. Denying author's request to delay publication:</strong><br>

  I apologize that we are unable to complete your below request of delaying the publication of the article.<br>
