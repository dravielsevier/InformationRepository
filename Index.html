<h1>Resupply Details</h1>
<p><strong>Allowed changes to XML and online PDF (and print in some cases)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is an erratum required?</strong> Yes, if the resupply concerns:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Errors/mistakes of a ‘serious’ nature which alter the scientific meaning or understanding of the article made by Elsevier (or by those working for Elsevier, such as Suppliers): for example not correcting errors indicated by the author in the returned author proof or introducing further errors during correction, etc.</li>
  <li>Serious errors/mistakes which would otherwise not appear on PubMed. [PubMed accepts only the first S300 supply and not S300 resupplies; Errata are always accepted and processed.]</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the print version of the issue containing the resupplied article can also be appropriately altered before printing if this is still possible.</p>
<p class="note">The list below cannot be fully itemized since it is not known what type of error might occur. The list may be subject to future updates and alterations. Below are given some general examples:</p>

<p class="note">
  * The Erratum (or Publisher’s note) will not only appear in print (for print subscribers) but also online in the XML version and in the online PDF file. If it is considered that an Erratum is not suitable then a Publisher’s note (PIT = ERR) should be used giving details of the changes made and making use of a ‘refers-to’ link with appropriate wording (and taking into consideration whether or not the print issue was also corrected in addition to the XML version and online PDF file). If the corrections lead to extra pages, then these extra pages must be made and allocated as e-pages.
